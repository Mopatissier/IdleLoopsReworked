            <b> May 1st, 2023 </b><br>
			Okay, I managed to finally the glitches in the space-time continuum, the squirrel should be a squirrel again! Also, this update is mostly about the new tutorial: it was a lot of work!<br><br>
			<b>Tutorial: </b><br>
			• The tutorial has been added! It will appear when you start a new savefile.<br>
			• Added a new zone that contains 18 actions for the tutorial, named Tutorialis.<br>
			• Sadly, once yout of the tutorial, you can't get back to that zone anymore.<br>
			• Multiple skills have been added, though they reset back to 0 once the tutorial is finished.<br>
			• Three big secrets have been added to that zone: their (non-gameplay) rewards stay between saves. I encourage you to back-up your save and chase them down!<br>
			• I can't stress enough how much work it was. It was supposed to be a small thing, it ended up way bigger than wanted!<br><br>
			<b>Offline system: </b><br>
			• The offline system now has to be unlocked by recruiting the squirrel.<br>
			• A new line has been added to show how much time is left before fatigue pauses your game, but only when fatigue has been capped.<br><br>
			<b>Quality of life: </b><br>
			• The April event is finished, and has been relegated to an option in the option menu. I blame this problem on the dark gods!<br>
			• The FAQ has been reworked and now shows the new tutorial pop-ups instead.<br>
			• An ending system has been added... Wait, what?<br><br>
			<b>Glitches and fixes: </b><br>
			• The squirrel version of Imbue Squirrel used to give 3x the exp it was supposed to.<br>
			• Some tooltips referencing potions have been rewritten, as the potion system has been changed in lore.<br>
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.3.8"><![CDATA[
            <b> April 1st, 2023 </b><br>
			This is just a small maintenance update, nothing big is happening. Wait, what do you mean, "squirrel"? There has never been any squirrel in this game? There's only a [SSSSHHHRRRR], and it always has been this way.<br><br>
			<b>Quality of life: </b><br>
			• The dungeon tooltips now always fit in the windows, like with the action tooltip with the previous update.<br><br>
			<b>Glitches and fixes: </b><br>
			• The witch squirrel action ignored the dark forest explored percentage.<br>			
			• Changed a few tooltips to make the shortcut/hermit and dark forest/witch relation more clear.<br>	
			• Action stories now stop being stuck in squirrel mode.<br>	
			• The pet squirrel action in ferret mode didn't change its icon for the action stories.<br>	
			• Fixed a glitch in the space-time continuum.<br>
			It's possible that it brings some weird glitches like changing the squirrel identity into a [SSSSHHHRRRR], so be careful!<br>	
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.3.7"><![CDATA[
            <b> March 12th, 2023 </b><br>
			I liked how I structured the last changelog, so I'll do the same this time again!<br>
			Oh, by the way, the tooltip refresh system has been reworked, though it shouldn't do change much for you.<br>
			<b>Offline system: </b><br>
			• Totally reworked!<br>
			• There's no longer any max offline time cap. You can get as much as you want.<br>
			• You can choose between 3 speeds of offline time consumption.<br>
			• A new Overclock mode has been added!<br>
			• It allows you to run the game at a constant x3 speed.<br>
			• But removes the gain of offline bonus time.<br>
			• If you're the type of player to leave the game open all day in a browser tab, this will avoid the issue where bonus time runs out and you're stuck at x1 for the rest of the day.<br><br>
			<b>Quality of life: </b><br>
			• The changelog menu has been reworked : you should now be able to see all of the last changelog content.<br>
			• The actions of zone 1 have been moved around to keep them better organized.<br>
			• Actions used to explore now display a checkmark once you get 100% for their exploration.<br>
			• Tooltips now show your total exploration exp gain.<br>
			• Action tooltips can no longer get out of bound if the game screen is too small.<br><br>
			<b>Glitches and fixes: </b><br>
			• Combining human and squirrel tooltips no longer erase the action stories. They also now update correctly.<br>			
			• Changed the description of reputation.<br>			
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.3.6"><![CDATA[
            <b> March 5th, 2023 </b><br>
			Okay, this is substantial update, I'll have to make categories for this one!<br><br>
			<b>Game balance: </b><br>
			• The magic figther have been weakened : unlocking it shouldn't give less skill exp now.<br>
			• Burning the forest now gives a looooot more mana.<br>
			• Potion skills exp gain is completely different, making them weaker at first, stronger later.<br>
			• The cost for making potions is now massively reduced.<br>
			• They now sell for only 100 gold now.<br>
			• The adventurer guild exam now uses a different formula.<br>
			• Teamwork training and its effects have been reworked.<br>
			• The large dungeon now gives more teamwork exp.<br>
			• The mock battles need different values to win.<br>
			• The offline bonus time is now capped off after 5 days. Hopefully that one won't make everyone hate me!<br><br>
			<b>New options: </b><br>
			• A new option have added so that progress bars can be removed once they get to 100%.<br>
			• Another new option that merges the tooltips of human and squirrel modes so you don't need to switch modes to view both.<br>
			<b>Squirrel: </b><br>
			• The squirrel can now only level up the same action once per loop.<br>
			• A new icon has been added to show it will level up an action but die as a result (the skull medal).<br>
			• Changed the icons that shows "this had no effect" and "this will level up the action".<br><br>
			<b>Quality of life: </b><br>
			• Tooltips now show when you gain exp from completing a segment of a multibar action.<br>
			• Actions now show what resources you gain from doing it (wandering gives pots, for exemple).<br>
			• Buff caps have been temporarily deactivated. No more confusion from their lack of use!<br><br>
			<b>Glitches and fixes: </b><br>
			• Fixed a looooot of typos.<br>
			• The delivery adress action now stops skipping the first step.<br>
			• Tail judges and squirrel leveling now shows their effect without needing to start a new loop.<br>
			• Actions that are locked can no longer be used in your loops.<br>
			• Ferret mode now displays ferret instead of squirrel everywhere correctly.<br>
			• Read books are now rightly unlocked at its tooltip value.<br>
			• You can't get multiple pairs of glasses at the same time. Sorry about that, please don't kill me for it!<br><br>
			<b>And most importantly: </b><br>
			... I made a bet that I would display the first logo attempt I get in the game and I won't back down so here you go:<br>

            <b> January 30th, 2023 </b>

            <b> September 1st, 2022 (again)</b>

			<version verNum="0.3.0"><![CDATA[
            <b> September 1st, 2022</b>

            Alright, it's time to work on the second zone! It has been unlocked, but is right now identical to the original forest, so I don't recommend trying it. You can still do it if you're bored, though. Also please do a backup before going in there!<br>

				<b>CONGRATULATION!</b><br><br>
				  
				You have been selected to be a potion courier for an alchemist guild.<br>
				That's what you've always dreamed of!<br>
				But how does it all work, again?<br>
				Well, there are 2 things to keep in mind. They are both at the top of the screen:<br><br>
				  
				<img src ="img/tutorial_0.png"><br><br>
				  
				<b>1:</b> Every potion starts with 500 mana. Every second, they lose mana: once they get to 0, the potion becomes useless and you have to start over.<br>
				One second = 100 mana. So you have 5 seconds to deliver them.<br>
				<b>2:</b> You can get items to help you for your potion delivery business. Once a delivery is finished, you have to place them back where you got them.<br>
				Sadly you can't keep them between deliveries... That would have been really helpful!<br><br>
				  
				Now that you know the essentials, it's time to get to your first day of work!<br>
				<b>Surely everything will go according to plan and you won't have any shenanigans involving a time loop, right?!</b><br><br>
				  
				<b>All of these tutorial pop-ups will be avaible in the FAQ tab so you can skip them and read them later if you want!</b><br><br>
				
				This game is a remake of the original game Idle Loops.<br>
				Starting as a balance patch, it became an entirely new game centered about a squirrel.<br>
				To play the latest version of the original game, check <a href="https://lloyd-delacroix.github.io/omsi-loops/">here</a>.<br>
				This is one of several versions of the original game: for other versions from the most complete to the less, check <a href="https://omsi6.github.io/loops/">here</a> and <a href="http://stopsign.github.io/idleLoops/">here</a>.<br>
				Thanks for playing, and have fun!<br><br>

			<b>ACTION LIST:</b><br><br>
			  
			Congrats! That was a first successful delivery! You're fit for this stuff!<br>
			But it won't be that easy every time. Thankfully you're a master at planning your day, so here's a new tool:<br>
			<img src ="img/tutorial_1.png"><br>
			<b>1:</b>The right part shows every action you'll do for each delivery.<br>
			<b>2:</b>The left part shows your current delivery progression.<br>
			<b>3:</b>This is a stack of actions: to add it, click (and drag) the actions from the action options to place them in the list.<br>
			<b>4:</b>There's a bunch of signs, here's a small description (ignore the star and human/squirrel icons for now!):<br>
			<i class='actionIcon far fa-circle'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Cap the number of actions to its max value.<br>
			<i class='actionIcon fas fa-plus'></i>/<i class='actionIcon fas fa-minus'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;: Add/Substract one action.<br>
			<i class='actionIcon fas fa-arrows-alt-h'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Split the stack of actions in two.<br>
			<i class='actionIcon fas fa-sort-up'></i>/<i class='actionIcon fas fa-sort-down'></i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;: Move up/down the stack.<br>
			<i class='actionIcon far fa-check-circle'></i><span style="margin-left: -2px;"> /</span><i class='actionIcon far fa-times-circle'></i> &nbsp;: Enable/disable a stack of actions.<br>
			<i class='actionIcon fas fa-times'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Remove the stack of actions.<br><br>
			  
			Well, that said, the best way to understand is to try it yourself. There's a few more options left for you to try.<br>
			<b>So don't hestitate to try everything to understand it! If you need a refresher, you can always look at the FAQ.</b><br><br>

				<b>STATS:</b><br><br>
				  
				Wow, you're really good at following your plans down to a T!<br>
				But how good-good at it are you really? That's where the next tool comes in handy:<br>
				<img src ="img/tutorial_2_0.png"><br>
				<b>1:</b> Your stat level show how fast you can complete actions. The higher, the less mana you spend for actions.<br>
				Your stats reset back to 0 after each delivery.<br>
				<b>2:</b> As you gain some stat exp, you also gain some talent exp: talent levels multiply stat exp gain.<br>
				They don't reset between deliveries!<br>
				<b>3:</b>This shows how many soulstones you have. Like talents, they multiply stat exp gain.<br>
				But as they're hidden deep in dungeons, you probably won't ever come to contact with one, right?<br><br>
				  
				Well, that's all good and well, but how do you get them? Well:<br>
				<img src ="img/tutorial_2_1.png"><br>
				<b>1:</b> You convert mana into experience: 50% Spd means 50% of the base mana cost is gained as speed exp.<br>
				It also means 50% of the acceleration bonus gained from your stats comes from your speed stat.<br>
				<b>2:</b> Sometimes, actions can multiply how much stat exp you gain from doing them.<br><br>
				  
				You're still wondering why your stats go back to 0 after each delivery...<br>
				Maybe this has something to do with all those delicious experimental potions you keep drinking?<br><br>

				<b>EXPLORATION AND RESOURCES:</b><br><br>

				You might know this town like the back of your own hand, but the alchemy guild's quarters? That's a new one.<br>
				You'll need to explore this place if you want to find reagents to make your potions last longer.<br>
				Sadly, most of them are not compatible with the potions you have to deliver...<br><br>
				  
				<img src ="img/tutorial_3.png"><br>
				<b>1:</b> As you fill the exploration bar, you will find more resources.<br>
				You need 100 exploration exp to fill the first percent, then 200, then 300,...<br>
				<b>2:</b> Those are the resources you have found, but the majority of them are useless.<br>
				<b>You'll have to try them one by one to sort them!</b><br>
				<b>3:</b> This is how many resources you have found that are actually <b>useful</b> to you in total.<br>
				<b>4:</b> This is how many useful resources are left available for this delivery.<br><br>
				  
				You really wish someone would guide you instead of having to try them all one by one...<br>
				Sadly, they keep saying it's a rite of passage around here!<br>
				Looks like you'll need to deliver more potions before getting some help.<br><br>

				<b>SKILLS AND BAR ACTIONS:</b><br><br>
				  
				Did you know there's more than stats? Well, now you know:<br><br>
				<img src ="img/tutorial_4_0.png"><br><br>
				  
				This is a skill. You'll need 100 exp to get the first level up, then 200, 300, etc.<br>
				Neat thing: <b>you keep them between deliveries!</b><br>
				They are useful for many thing, for exemple, bar actions:<br><br>
				<img src ="img/tutorial_4_1.png"><br><br>
				  
				Every bar action will have a different utility. You'll have to read its tooltip to know its use!<br>	  
				Every mana spent on this action will fill out the bar by a certain number.<br>
				That number is decided by a formula: it usually looks like (skills)*(stats)*(number of time completed).<br>
				The formula is also unique to each action: <b>it is very important to check the formula to fully understand what you need!</b><br><br>
				  
				Well, speaking of, that next potion delivery action is a bar action!<br>
				What a coincidence! Who would have seen that coming???<br><br>

				<b>SQUIRREL MODE:</b><br><br>
				  
				Oh, the messenger squirrel's vacation has ended, deliveries should be easier now!<br><br>
				  
				When you do an action in squirrel mode, it will have a different effect:<br>
				You'll have to check the tooltip of the action in squirrel mode to see what it does:<br>
				<img src ="img/tutorial_5_0.png"><br>
				As you see, you can level up the squirrel version of the action by fulfilling some conditions!<br>
				But remember: <b>you can only level up the same action once per delivery!</b><br><br>
				  
				But how do you do an action in squirrel mode? It's simple, just add an action in squirrel mode or click on this icon:<br>
				<img src ="img/tutorial_5_1.png"><br>
				The human mode icon will be replaced by one of those icons:<br>
				<img src ="img/petSquirrel.svg" style="width:20px;margin-bottom:-3px"> : This action will happen as normal.<br>
				<img src ="img/squirrelLose.svg" style="width:20px;margin-bottom:-3px"> : Doing this action will make you lose the squirrel, so be careful!<br>
				<img src ="img/squirrelSleep.svg" style="width:20px;margin-bottom:-3px"> : This action will have no effect.<br>
				<img src ="img/squirrelLevelUp.svg" style="width:20px;margin-bottom:-3px"> : This will level up the action!<br>
				<img src ="img/squirrelLevelUpLose.svg" style="width:20px;margin-bottom:-3px"> : It will level up the action, but make you lose the squirrel, according to your gut feelings.<br><br>
				  
				Oh, and here's a little trick. Remember this icon?<br>
				<img src ="img/tutorial_5_2.png"><br>
				Clicking it will favorite human mode or squirrel mode for the action!<br>
				In other word : <b>this action will always be added in the list in the mode you favored.</b><br>
				This is pretty useful if an action is just objectively better in squirrel mode!<br><br>
				 
				With this, nothing will be able to stop you!<br>
				Just in time, too: it looks like the higher up decided to give you your first big mission.<br><br>

				Oh hey, a squirrel just under your feet! Wait, wh<b>WAIT NO, THE PACKA-</b><br><br>
				
				Before realizing what's happening, you feel a sharp pain, hear a breaking sound, and feel something wet on you.<br>
				<b><i>D... Did you just accidentally trip on the potion and got it spilled on you?!</b></i><br>
				And you even broke your glasses...<br><br>
				
				Let's try staying calm about this: what SHOULD <b>YOU DO <i>NOW?!</i></b><br>
				As you start to panic, you suddenly feel weird. Something seems to pull you back...<br><br>
				
				<b>As you blink, you find yourself back on the ground, where you tripped.</b><br>
				<i>This time, confusion takes over your mind.</i> What just happened? Your first thoughts direct you to the potion.<br>
				Yes! Yes... You can feel a familiar sensation... Mana leaking, but coming out of yourself instead of a potion.<br><br>

				<b>As you blink, you find yourself back on the ground, where you tripped.</b><br>

				It feels like you were right about this. But why would the loop poti-<i>Oooooooooooh...</i><br><br>
				
				<b>As you blink, you find yourself back on the ground, where you tripped.</b><br>
				<i>This time, resignation takes over your mind.</i> Are you stuck in a time loop? Can you do anything about it?<br>
				Surely there's a way to at least make the loop longer? Maybe if you get more mana...<br><br>
				
				<b>As you blink, you find yourself back on the ground, where you tripped.</b><br>
				<i>This time, determination takes over your mind.</i> You've seen it during your travel: pots around here contain mana.<br>

				<b>UNLOCKING A NEW POWER:</b><br><br>
				
				As soon as the squirrel decides to join you for real across all loops, you feel a weird sensation...<br>
				You feel whole. As if reuniting everything affected by the loop potion unlocked something.<br>
				And it fact, it did!<b> You just unlocked a new ability!</b><br><br>
				
				You realize some time ago that you gained the power to stop time for a while.<br>
				That was super useful for planning the next loops, but... It still felt like a waste of time.<br><br>
				
				<b><i><u>Bonus time:</u></b></i><br><br>
				
				Well, good news: from now on, <b>time spent in that paused state is accumulated to be spent later!</b><br>
				Let's call this accumulated time "Bonus time". <b>By spending bonus time, you can accelerate the flow of time!</b><br>
				You also have the unexplained feeling that you can also accumulate "time spent offline", whatever that means...<br><br>
				
				While you're getting excited about this new power, you feel the squirrel getting agitated.<br>
				Apparently it felt a new, different power from the one you just got?<br><br>
				
				<b><i><u>Overclock:</u></b></i><br><br>
				
				According to it, you can reject that previous power by pushing your limits. Let's call this "Overclock".<br>
				Doing so will <b>accelerate the flow of time by 3 forever!</b> However, it has drawbacks...<br>
				First, <b>you won't be able to gain any bonus time in that state.</b><br>
				Second, <b>you will accumulate fatigue</b>, which will force you to take a pause after a while.<br><br>
				
				Alternatively, you could always switch between those 2 powers, there's no need to commit.<br>
				Though be careful in that case: <b>fatigue will prevent you from gaining bonus time.</b><br><br>
				
				<i><b>If you like interacting with the game all day, Overclock is for you. Otherwise, it's best to not activate it.</b></i><br><br>

				They look pretty please with it:<br><br>
				
				"SO YOU HAVE CLEARED ALL MY TRIALS. I AM PROUD OF YOU.<br>
				YOU HAVE NOW MATURED ENOUGH FOR YOU TO... WAIT...<br>
				HAVE YOU NOT? HOW DID YOU GET THAT LOOP POTION THEN?"<br><br>
				
				You suddenly hear a sinister laughing around you.<br>
				It seems to come from everywhere at the same time?<br><br>
				
				"THE DARK GODS? DID THEY TRICK YOU WITH THIS POTION?<br>
				YOU FOOL, THAT ISN'T A LOOP POTION! AND NOW THAT I HAVE STARTED THE RITUAL, IT WILL..."<br><br>
				
				The ground starts to shake.<br>
				This doesn't look good...<br><br>
				
				"NO! TIME GOT DAMAGED! THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED!<br>
				WHY HAVE YOU-"<br><br>
				
				Chronos suddenly disappears.<br>
				Actually, everything around starts disappearing as well...<br><br>
				
				Scared, you look at your squirrel.<br>
				It looks transparent... And so is your hand. You feel yourself slowly disappearing...<br><br>
				
				<b>Something tells you that you made a mistake.</b><br><br>

                You're a simple courier, on a long trip to deliver a high priority package. Just as you entered town,
                you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you.
                Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana became empty, you
                found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves
                filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you,
                until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are
                often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...
            </story>
            <story num="1">
                You reach the end of the dungeon, where a softly glowing orb floats on a pedastal. You've found the
                dungeon core - for the first level of the dungeon, at least. As you grasp it, the essence dives into
                you, infusing your very being with the power it holds. It is a small amount of power, but this is a
                small dungeon. You'll be back to take this power again, knowing with the foreign knowledge implanted
                that it will stay with you no matter when you are.
            </story>
            <story num="2">
                You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been
                thought that dungeon cores build based on the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the
                essence of it's previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to
                put more mana into the world to take the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another
                oddity of the loops.

            You've done it! You've bested the gods themselves and restored time to its rightful flow. You can stop looping at any moment.
                But, then again, you could keep going. There's always time later...<br><br>

			<explanation><![CDATA[
          Each stat level reduces the relevant part of an action's mana cost by sqrt(1 + level/100).<br>
          Talent exp gain is equal to 1% of stat exp gain, and persists through loops.<br>
          Talent multiplies xp gain by (1 + sqrt(talentLevel)/2).<br>
          XP gain towards a stat per action is (original mana / actual mana) * (talent bonus) * (soulstone bonus) per tick.<br><br>
     
          e.g. Meet People costs 1600 mana and has a breakdown of <b>Int</b> 10% <b>Cha</b> 80% <b>Soul</b> 10%.<br>
          This effectively means 160 of the mana is controlled by <b>Int</b>, another 160 by <b>Soul</b>, and the remaining 1280 by <b>Cha</b>.<br>
          If your <b>Cha</b> is level 125 when the action is started, the bonus would be sqrt(2.25) = x1.5 so it'd be 1280 / 1.5 = 853.33.<br>
          Adding back the 160 from <b>Soul</b> and <b>Int</b>, the total mana the action takes (rounded up) is now 1174, so ~73% of the original mana cost.<br>
          The action would give (1600/1174)*(1+sqrt(talent)/2) level exp per mana for the 1174 mana.<br>]]></explanation>

Trisha. You manage to pry most of her relationship with the hermit from her. They were lovers once, this you knew, but what you didn't was that she was of nobility and he a common vagabond. She fell for him and him for her, it was a love for the ages she tells you while drunk from the wine you brought along with you. He wanted to run away with her and she agreed, too love struck to question why. He was running from deals he had made and bargains he had forsaken, his glib tounge landing him in trouble of the otherworldly nature. Trisha seems frustrated with her youth's naivety as she tells you how she was made a scapegoat for his failings and forfeits in his deals and bargains. How she was essentially sold to the dark gods as his forfeit. When you ask what she did in return, all Trisha does is smile with dark satisfaction, the fire flaring briefly.]]></story_8>

			<story_3><![CDATA[<b>D Rank achieved:</b>⮀ You hone your skills at all parts of a construction job, and the breadth seems to count in your favour. This is about the level, you're told, where people often settle into modestly-paying stable careers.]]></story_3>
			<story_4><![CDATA[<b>C Rank achieved:</b>⮀ B-rank craftswoman Wilfrey says a house you built wouldn't be out of place in most parts of town. She shares with you a tip: to make it into B-rank, you have to know more than construction. If building houses is all you can do, well, a C-rank income still isn't anything to scoff at.]]></story_4>
			<story_5><![CDATA[<b>B Rank achieved:</b>⮀ Taking Wilfrey's advice you branch out into working with cloth, glass, and metal.

			<story_7><![CDATA[<b>S Rank achieved:</b>⮀ Slowly, you remove mistakes from your work and learn to find even the most subtle of defects. When you and the old grandmasters butt heads they have less to throw at you and you fire back with flaws in their own work.]]></story_7>
			<story_8><![CDATA[<b>U Rank achieved:</b>⮀ It's official: you're unmatched here in Merchanton. Try as they might, the grandmasters can't find any mistakes in the things you make, and as you begin an exhaustive list of their own imperfections they grudgingly agree that you are superior, though you don't miss the way they talk about you behind your back.]]></story_8>
			<story_9><![CDATA[<b>Godlike Rank achieved:</b>⮀ At last, you've finally broken their pride. You've gone beyond perfection and into the realm of revolution. Your new methods, honed by countless hours of experimentation, are so superior that even the proud old grandmasters bow their heads and humbly ask you to teach them. Victory is sweet.]]></story_9>

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ Chronomancy is unlike any other magic you've practiced, and unbelievably finnicky. The mana has to be held perfectly still, as if time is at a standstill, and the slightest mistake will cause the entire spell to destabilize. It's hard work, but you finally get the hang of it and you feel yourself speed up by the barest fraction.]]></story_1>

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Pyromancy:</b>⮀ Pyromancy is more normal than chronomancy, but it makes up for it by being extra dangerous.
