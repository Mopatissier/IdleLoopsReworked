			<version verNum="0.2.5"><![CDATA[
            <b> August 24th, 2022</b>
            • Added all the squirrel actions in the forest!<br>
            • Tweaked a few forest actions.<br>
            • The feed animals action now gives you the squirrel if you didn't recruit it yet. You monster!<br>
            • Surprisingly, fixed a lot of glitches!<br>
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.2.4"><![CDATA[
            <b> August 16th, 2022</b>
            • Added a new zone! Like the forest, it lacks squirrel actions and story bits for now. Wait, which zone? Well... That's up to you to discover. Just one hint : it's not after the forest.<br>
            • Changed the way travelling works : now, there can be alternative zones.<br>
            • Fixed a ton of glitches and typos.<br>
            • Reworked the yin yang magic tooltip.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.2.3"><![CDATA[
            <b> August 11st, 2022</b>
            • Massive rework for all the action tooltips! Now they should all be more readable, and be way more easy on the eyes. No more missing effects by misreading!<br>
            • Fixed a lot of glitches that were in the forest.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.2.2"><![CDATA[
            <b> August 10th, 2022</b>
            • Implemented all actions in the forest. There's no action stories nor squirrel actions yet, and numbers are prone to change, though!<br>
            • Fixed a visual glitch for firefox if you got high talent numbers.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.2.1"><![CDATA[
            <b> August 6th, 2022</b>
            • Discovered a massive flaw in the level system, so it was reworked. Now levels are less efficient, but are still quite powerful. Talents and soulstones are untouched.<br>
            • Fixed a few glitches, as per usual.<br>
            • Made the dungeon too strong in the last update, nerfed it a bit.<br>
            • Changed the mana cost of all actions in the forest.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.2.0"><![CDATA[
            <b> August 4th, 2022</b>
            Alright, it's time to work on the second zone! It has been unlocked, but is right now identical to the original forest, so I don't recommend trying it. You can still do it if you're bored, though. Also please do a backup before going in there!<br>
            • Fixed a few glitches, including one where the squirrel would eat your gold in your back.<br>
            • Made the small dungeon a bit harder.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.9"><![CDATA[
            <b> August 1st, 2022</b>
            • Even more typos and glitched fixed! When will it stop?!<br>
            • The tab name is now "Idle Loops Reworked".<br>
            • Reworked the story bit tooltips! It is now more comfortable to read them.<br>
            • Rewrote the squirrel mode bits for petting the squirrel.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.8"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 30th, 2022</b>
            • Fixed even more glitches and typos found by the alpha testers. My endless thanks!<br>
            • The party action and its squirrel actions have been slightly reworked.<br>
            • No more tooltips out of the screen!<br>
            • The magic fighter is no longer an action you should have access to... But I'll leave it for now, just as an optional challenge.<br>
            • Reputation is now more valuable! Supplies are now 450 gold, and haggle removes 30 gold.<br>
			• Every timer should now show minutes, hours and days too, instead of just seconds.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.7"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 29th, 2022</b>
            • Fixed some more glitches found by the alpha testers. Thank you again!<br>
            • The hitbox for the little checkbox for switching mode is now way bigger.<br>
			• When clicking on the icon/human icon in the action list, you can now change the mode for that specific action! Now it's less awkward to set up your loop.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.6"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 29th, 2022</b>
            • Fixed some glitch found by the alpha testers. Thank you!<br>
            • Fixed a lot of typos.<br>
			• From now on, once you lose your squirrel, you can't pet it anymore in that same loop.<br>
			• Added an hotkey for squirrel mode : shift + space toggles it on and off.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.5"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 28th, 2022</b>
			Finally, here's the first version that's complete enough to be played! Have fun, everyone!<br>
            • Added all the squirrel actions.<br>
			• The magic figther is now finished.<br>
			• Fixed a variety of small glitches.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.4"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 25th, 2022</b>
            • Buffed the exp system. Talents are now more powerful, and soulstones are similar, but stronger at the start. Additionally, you get twice more exp from the start.<br>
			• Reworked a bit the squirrel and the magic figther. They'll soon be complete!<br>
			• Fixes a few UI glitches that slipped in the last update.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.3"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 24th, 2022</b>
            With the help of Reterino, reworked the UI for the stats and skills. It is now more compact and can allow everything to be seen wihtout needing to scroll down.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.2"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 23th, 2022</b>
            • Added the squirrel mode! Right now, only "Wander" is compatible with it, but the rest will be added soon.<br>
			• Various little fixes, included some from more recent version of Lloyd's Idle Loops.<br>
			• Added the zone quick acces menu from Lloyd's latest version.<br>
			• Slightly changed the changelog : it didn't like having version names too long.
            ]]></version>
			<version verNum="0.1.1"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 19th, 2022</b>

                <q>What do stats do?</q>
                <a>Hover over "Stats" for how they work. What stats are important depend on what actions you need that
                    uses them.
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>Short runs seem better.</q>
                <a>Short runs are better for the early game, but as your runs get longer and you accrue
                    talent and soulstones, longer runs become more useful.
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>What should my first goal be?</q>
                <a>Start with wandering until you have ways of getting mana back. Then try to find how to get some
                    warrior lessions to give yourself a permanent boost, and then try fighting monsters!
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>How do skill increases / reductions work?</q>
                <a>Increases multiply a reward by (1 + level / 60) ^ .25, so you'll see diminishing returns at higher levels.
                Reductions multiply a cost by 1 / (1 + level / 100), so you'll never be able to bring a cost completely to zero.
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>When should I use Dark Ritual?</q>
                <a>Many people recommend performing another ritual when the cost is less than 5% of your soulstones.
                Of course, the choice is up to you and there may be cases where it's better to perform it sooner or later.

      TUTORIAL:<br>
	  
	  You are stuck in a time loop.<br>
	  You have 500 mana until the loop restarts.<br>
	  1 second = 100 mana.<br>
	  Wander around to find pots : some will have mana inside.<br>
	  Your character will remember which one have mana and which one don't, but you'll have to check them first.<br>
	  Try to complete the town first!<br>
	  And remember : read all the tooltips!<br><br>
	  
	  This game is a balance rework of the original Idle Loops.<br>
	  To play the latest version of the original game, check <a href="https://lloyd-delacroix.github.io/omsi-loops/">here</a>.<br>
	  This is one of several versions of the game : for other versions from the most complete to the less, check <a href="https://omsi6.github.io/loops/">here</a> and <a href="http://stopsign.github.io/idleLoops/">here</a>.<br>
	  Thanks for playing, and have fun!<br><br>

                You're a simple courier, on a long trip to deliver a high priority package. Just as you entered town,
                you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you.
                Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana became empty, you
                found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves
                filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you,
                until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are
                often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...

                You reach the end of the dungeon, where a softly glowing orb floats on a pedastal. You've found the
                dungeon core - for the first level of the dungeon, at least. As you grasp it, the essence dives into
                you, infusing your very being with the power it holds. It is a small amount of power, but this is a
                small dungeon. You'll be back to take this power again, knowing with the foreign knowledge implanted
                that it will stay with you no matter when you are.
            </story>
            <story num="2">
                You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been
                thought that dungeon cores build based on the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the
                essence of it's previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to
                put more mana into the world to take the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another
                oddity of the loops.

			<explanation><![CDATA[
          Each stat level reduces the relevant part of an action's mana cost by sqrt(1 + level/100).<br>
          Talent exp gain is equal to 1% of stat exp gain, and persists through loops.<br>
          Talent multiplies xp gain by (1 + sqrt(talentLevel)/2).<br>
          XP gain towards a stat per action is (original mana / actual mana) * (talent bonus) * (soulstone bonus) per tick.<br><br>
     
          e.g. Meet People costs 1600 mana and has a breakdown of <b>Int</b> 10% <b>Cha</b> 80% <b>Soul</b> 10%.<br>
          This effectively means 160 of the mana is controlled by <b>Int</b>, another 160 by <b>Soul</b>, and the remaining 1280 by <b>Cha</b>.<br>
          If your <b>Cha</b> is level 125 when the action is started, the bonus would be sqrt(2.25) = x1.5 so it'd be 1280 / 1.5 = 853.33.<br>
          Adding back the 160 from <b>Soul</b> and <b>Int</b>, the total mana the action takes (rounded up) is now 1174, so ~73% of the original mana cost.<br>
          The action would give (1600/1174)*(1+sqrt(talent)/2) level exp per mana for the 1174 mana.<br>]]></explanation>

			Acts if you have have (buff level) minimum reputation on you, for both yin and yang magic.<br>
			For example, if you have this buff at level 3 with 10 reputation:<br>
			The yin magic will be activated as if you have -3 reputations.<br>
			The yang magic will be activated as if you have 10 reputations.<br><br>
			
			Right now, you have this buff at level <div id='skillBuffYinYangLevel'></div> with <div id='skillBuffYinYangReputation'></div> reputations:<br>
			The yin magic is activated as if you have -<div id='skillBuffYinYangYangReputation'></div> reputations.<br>
			The yang magic is activated as if you have <div id='skillBuffYinYangYinReputation'></div> reputations.<br><br>
			
			Currently, yin and yang magic together give a bonus speed of <div id='skillBuffYinYang'></div>x.

The witch is surprisingly personable for what you would consider a stereotypical 'Wicked Witch'.]]></story_3>

            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>80% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ The witch is struck with a strange sense of melancholy one loop and you have no idea why, but the witch is strangely open with information and you manage to pry out more of the relationship between her and the Hermit. They were lovers once, and to your surprise, she used to be the one whom nature adores. She shuts up quickly after letting that slip. You're all the more determined to pry it out of her though.]]></story_7>
            <story_8><![CDATA[<b>100% Witch knowledge learned:</b>⮀ Somehow she seems to sense something about you this loop, and she tells you her name, and its the name she gives for every loop after. Trisha. You manage to pry most of her relationship with the hermit from her. They were lovers once, this you knew, but what you didn't was that she was of nobility and he a common vagabond. She fell for him and him for her, it was a love for the ages she tells you while drunk from the wine you brought along with you. He wanted to run away with her and she agreed, too love struck to question why. He was running from deals he had made and bargains he had forsaken, his glib tounge landing him in trouble of the otherworldly nature. Trisha seems frustrated with her youth's naivety as she tells you how she was made a scapegoat for his failings and forfeits in his deals and bargains. How she was essentially sold to the dark gods as his forfeit. When you ask what she did in return, all Trisha does is smile with dark satisfaction, the fire flaring briefly.]]></story_8>

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Pyromancy:</b>⮀ Pyromancy is more normal than chronomancy, but it makes up for it by being extra dangerous.
